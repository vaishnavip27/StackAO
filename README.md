StackAO
StackAO is Stack Overflow, on AO. Here, users can join in communities and ask their doubts away. And since I believe in open-sourcing, anyone who is in the community can answer existing doubts. People can also upvote answers they like. 
AO makes creating the platform very seamless. The concept of chatroom can be applied to communities and users can interact in the AO process itself. 

Note: I am committed to continuing this project irrespective of the hacker house selection.

Tech stacks used : React.js for the frontend
                   Lua for the backend

Adding some screenshots of the backend outputs
